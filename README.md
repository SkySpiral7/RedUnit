# RedUnit

RedUnit is a free, open source **unit testing framework** for **Red** language. 
Inspired by xUnit, nUnit, PhpUnit and other similar libraries.

### Motivation

The main reason is the possibility to building your own projects faster and easier.

The TDD (test driven-development) approach is now possible using the **RedUnit** tool, so you can eliminate bad cases at the early stage.

## Running the tests

The **RedUnit** unit test framework obviously can't test itself - so for now it does not have any tests. In the future releases I plan to write some simple scripts - to be able to test particular parts of RedUnit.

## Compatibility

Project was created and tested under **0.6.3** version of Red. Older versions were not tested.

### Historical note

This tool was earlier a part of various tools, that I created for Red language. When project became bigger, it was divided into a independent repositories.
